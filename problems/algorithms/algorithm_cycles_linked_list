O(n) time complexity

Always store some node to check. Occasionally reset this node to avoid the "Detect Only Full Loops" problem. When resetting it, double the amount of time before resetting it again.


O(n) time complexity

Simultaneously go through the list by ones (slow iterator) and by twos (fast iterator). If there is a loop the fast iterator will go around that loop twice as fast as the slow iterator. The fast iterator will lap the slow iterator within a single pass through the cycle. Detecting a loop is then just detecting that the slow iterator has been lapped by the fast iterator.
